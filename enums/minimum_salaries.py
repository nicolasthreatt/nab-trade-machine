    Teams with cap room available will have a little more flexibility to sign players to longer-term minimum salary contracts,
    but over-the-cap clubs will still be able to use the minimum salary exception to add as many players as roster limits allow,
    for contracts of up to two years. Unlike other exceptions, such as the mid-level or the bi-annual,
    the minimum salary exception can be used multiple times.
